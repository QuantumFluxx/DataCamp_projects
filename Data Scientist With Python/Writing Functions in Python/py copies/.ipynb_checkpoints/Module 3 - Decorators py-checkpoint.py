She has seen that you can modify, delete, or overwrite the values needed by the nested function, but the nested function can still access those values because they are stored safely in the function's closure. She even realized that you could run into memory issues if you wound up adding a very large array or object to the closure, and has resolved to keep her eye out for that sort of problem.\n",

The decorator print_before_and_after() defines a nested function wrapper() that calls whatever function gets passed to print_before_and_after(). wrapper() adds a little something else to the function call by printing one message before the decorated function is called and another right afterwards. Since print_before_and_after() returns the new wrapper() function, we can use it as a decorator to decorate the multiply() function."
